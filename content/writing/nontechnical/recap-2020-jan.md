description: a belated recap, highlighting my best writing over the past couple months

Hello mailing list friends!

First things first: **This mailing list will be changing frequency.** I will be sending updates once a week instead of once a month, starting next Friday. Just wanted to give a heads up because it does change the expectations I originally set.

The good news is that I'm doing this because I'm writing a lot more. I didn't have much to report for December (didn't end up getting very far with Rails, just didn't spark joy), but hit a good streak in January writing something every day. 

Some highlights from the past 2 months:

- **Technical**
  - [Why I Enjoy Svelte](https://www.swyx.io/writing/svelte-why): Reasons I enjoy Svelte, despite not using it for work
  - [Svelte Zen Garden](https://www.swyx.io/writing/svelte-zen-garden): reigniting the Zen Garden era with modern technology
  - [Optimistic, Offline-First Apps](https://www.swyx.io/writing/svelte-amplify-datastore): This is my attempt adapting an Amplify DataStore tutorial to Svelte
  - [Best Practice Open Source Repo Setup](https://www.swyx.io/writing/oss-repo-setup): Quick and simple ways to set up Open Source Repos with Best Practices
  - [The Many Jobs of JS Build Tools](https://www.swyx.io/writing/jobs-of-js-build-tools): A discussion of why JS developers use build tools like Webpack and what we do with them, for new JS developers.
- **Non Technical**
  - [Favorite Podcasts](https://www.swyx.io/writing/fave-podcasts): 250 Podcasts I enjoy listening to
  - [Two Words](https://www.swyx.io/writing/two-words): The best way to sell to, brand, persuade, or inspire people is to condense your idea down to Two Words.
  - [Collapsing Layers](https://www.swyx.io/writing/collapsing-layers): As Moore's Law ends, devices multiply, and software becomes critical to life, we must take another look at our full stack for continued gains in efficiency, reliability and security.
  - [CFP Advice](https://www.swyx.io/writing/cfp-advice): Some thoughts on writing your first few CFPs
  - [The Ultimate Hack for Learning In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public-hack): for people wanting to #LearnInPublic faster

I'm still in my product rotation at work, so I haven't done any speaking. In fact this year I'm mostly only doing remote talks, trying to travel less. (Hit me up if you organize a remote event!)

That's it from me. All the best for your February, all 29 days of it!
