> ⚠️ Update: I have moved off of Novela because I discovered enough differences between my needs and their design goals that it was no longer worth basing on them. Instead I now maintain my own theme at https://github.com/sw-yx/gatsby-theme-dev-blog

My first post using `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`. Novela is built by the team at [Narative](https://narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web.

I livestreamed the 2hr process of moving the blog over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLJirjROqU8
