    description2: Babel-Macros were shipped with Create-React-App v2 - but what are they? What can you do with them? In this lightning talk we discuss how babel macros differ from plugins, and my recent work with babel-blade creating an inline GraphQL compiler that works with all React GraphQL clients.
    description3: Babel-Macros were shipped with Babel v7 - but what are they? What can you do with them? In this lightning talk we discuss how babel macros differ from plugins, and my recent work with babel-blade creating an inline GraphQL compiler that works with all clientside GraphQL clients.
    graphqlasianotes: No technical requirements apart from internet connection. I am the best person to speak on the subject because I made this macro https://babel-blade.netlify.com. Initially it was just a cool toy but then people at Coursera, Netflix, FB, and Adobe have picked up it telling me to keep going so I am applying for a lightning talk so I can spread the idea and get feedback/collaboration with the major clientside GraphQL clients!

    description: We all use create-react-app but how much do we know about how it works internally? In this talk we discuss how I recently dived into the source code for create-react-app to make a fun clone! It looks intimidating but is really not, once you get a hang of how lerna monorepos work and try making one of your own. Watch this and then go make your own create-awesome-app!
