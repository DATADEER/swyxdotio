A recorded casual chat I had with the Amazon Pay India team on JAMstack topics. The audience is a mix of technical and nontechnical team members, so this is a more high level/introductory overview.

Preprepared topics:

- What is a static site, when can we say a website is static and when is it dynamic?
- How long do you think static sites have been around ?
- How have static sites evolved into MPA(Multipage Applications) and SPAs(Single Page Applications) ?
- How Single Page Applications came into picture?
- Why have we gone full circle STATIC → DYNAMIC SITES → MPA → SPA → STATIC SITES
- Client Side Rendered  Apps vs Server Side Rendered Apps  vs Static Site 
- Your preferred Static Site Generator and Hosting Service and why?
- What is JAM stack and how does it play with Static Sites?
- When building an app when should we consider Static Site Generators vs SPA vs Server Side Rendered Apps?
- In Amazon, where we have server side rendered pages in most of our client side facing pages, can we  introduce Statically Rendered Pages and what benefits will it bring?
