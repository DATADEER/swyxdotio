    "description": "Modern JS frameworks have run into a quandary - what we write is what we ship. Despite our best efforts at minifying and treeshaking, we cannot fight the fact that adding features means adding JS bundle size. This means we are often trading off user experience against developer experience for every fatiguing decision we make. But it doesn't have to be this way. As Tom Dale predicted, Compilers are the new Frameworks. Svelte is an exciting, newer JavaScript framework that was designed from the ground up with compilation and speed. In this talk, we'll look under its hood to understand how it works, so you know when and why you'd want to use it in future. Don't worry, it isn't Rocket Science!",
